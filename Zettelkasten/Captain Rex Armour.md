# Captain Rex Armour

I want to 3D print a full set of Captain Rex's armour to build an accurate cosplay. I will be basing this off the Rex that is shown in the Ahsoka series so will have a more realistic look. The core STL files are coming from [[#^59f947|Galactic Armoury]] and printed on my Voron 2.4 at home.

Given the print size of my printer is 300mm$^3$ it will have to be separated into smaller models to print and then later attached together.
