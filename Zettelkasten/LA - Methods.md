# LA - Methods

When making methods for the app each method should have a clear pronounceable name with as small an amount of parameters as possible the ideal method has no parameters, 1 parameter is good and 2 is acceptable but if a method has 3 or more it needs to be reconsidered. This ensures that anyone can easy understand a method at a glance and doesn't need to dig into documents each time they need to use it.

Methods should serve a single function that is clearly outlined in the methods name. If a method needs to have a comment explaining what it does then that is considered a failure so large methods that perform multiple functions should be broken down into multiple functions this way when something needs updating or changing then it is simple to fix the method avoiding having to update multiple parts of functionality when only one part of the functionality needs to change.
