Up: [[LonelyAddicts]] [[LA - Mobile Application]]

# LA - Login and Sign up Page

The first page in the app that a user will see after first downloading the app in the login/sign up page so we want it to establish the design for the app as a whole so the users first view is consistent with what the whole experience will be.

The page will have a centred element with 2 tabs at the top the default tab being sign in and the second tab being sign up. There will be the text input fields if the user decides/decided to sign up with email and then the buttons for all major login services such as google or apple id.

The code behind this will then connect to the [[LA - Supabase|Supabase]] instance to authenticate.
