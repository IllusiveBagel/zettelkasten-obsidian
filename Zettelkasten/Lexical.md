# Lexical

Lexical is a Javascript framework that creates a Notion/Obsidian style markdown editor. Lexical leans more towards the notion style giving the option to drag and drop elements anywhere in the editor so you can rearrange the document.

This will be a useful tool for future projects for document generation and editing.
