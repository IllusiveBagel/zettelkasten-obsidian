# LA - Variables

Much like the methods all variable names must be clear and easily pronounceable and clearly state exactly what the variable is storing. Single let variables should be avoided apart from local variables such as in for loops so that variables are searchable and you aren't left having to trace things through the code to find a variable.

With the use of typescript all variables should have a type defined so at all points we know for sure what each variable is and can ensure everything is correctly type matched.
