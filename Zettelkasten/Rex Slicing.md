# Rex Slicing

There are a few factors I need to consider when slicing the Rex models to ensure I have a good middle ground between weight and strength.

After watching the official Galactic Armory video on printing helmets I have found some good print settings they go with a layer height of 0.3mm over 0.2mm to reduce print time and go with 5% infill this doesn't reduce the strength at all but does greatly reduce the weight and print time of each model.
