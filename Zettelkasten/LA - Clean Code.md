# LA - Clean Code

Clean readable code is very important this includes code formatting so [[#^f9d473|Prettier]] will be implemented and configured to ensure that no matter who picks up the code it will be formatted the same and will auto format if something is done that doesn't match the configured standard. This will also be run in combination with a linter.

The exact linter has yet to be chosen but this will be aligned with the prettier config to ensure that they don't conflict on anything. The linter will also be run on commit to ensure no code that doesn't fit with the standards is added to the repo.
