Tags: #DnD

Where the city lives on the coast there is a large port that can hold hundreds of boats and ships. This area is the only break in the city walls.

The port see's thousands of people coming and going every day and all of the cities trade flows through the port from young witches and wizards coming to study at the [[University of Magic]] to all major resources that can't be produced locally.

Where the city walls open up at both sides of the port are large status of wizards and witches some of which are well known figures who studied at the university but the names and lives of the older statuses have been lost to time.
