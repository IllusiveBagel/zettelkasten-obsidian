The main city is a large walled city that is a magical centre where wizards come from all over to study and experience the city. The economy within the city is dependant on its many shops and magical tourism. The city has a wagon wheel like road structure with the [[University of Magic]] in the very middle of the city. 

The city is the largest city to not be ruled by any form of monarch and instead has an elected government that is primarily filled with high powered wizards and witches.
