Links: [[Main City]]
Tags: #DnD

Over many years the outer parts of the city have been abandoned because the buildings are being over run by some form of dark taint. No one know what is causing this but the city is evacuating people from the buildings as it expands with wizards placed around the districts trying to slow it down. The taint seems to be coming from the outside of the city in but only exists within the city walls that aren't effected.

The taint has been the [[University of Magic]]'s main area of study since it started many years ago but the people performing the research have moved on and changed so many times that no one really know when it started anymore and the wizards researching it seem to always leave the study but they all refuse to explain why.
