Links: [[Main City]]
Tags: #DnD

The city is run by the magic council which consists of 6 elected council members. Originally the council was put in place to run the [[University of Magic]] but as the city expanded around the university the council took control of the university and the city surrounding it.

Only magic users can become members of the council as it is believed with magic being the heart of the city only magic users have the best interests of the city in mind. The council members have always been powerful wizards that studied at the university there are no specific rules about this and many believe something is going on around this as many wizards who did not study at the university have run for the council but always withdraw before the election takes place.

Magic users do not have to pay tax in the city but non magic users do as the council considers them less useful to the city and often a burden on the community. Most of the funding for the city comes directly from the university. Many people have asked for the university to be audited as many of the funding seemingly comes from no where but the council block these audits before they take place.

The city has little interactions with other places, some trade in and out through the [[Main City Port]] but the city has no allies and does not offer support to others despite being the largest city with the most resources.

Despite the rampant discrimination towards non magic users this city is still considered one of the most accepting places to live as all races and species are considered equal.
