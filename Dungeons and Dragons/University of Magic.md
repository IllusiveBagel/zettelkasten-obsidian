The university is the oldest part of the city with it existing before the city was built around it. This is considered the best place to learn and perfect magic and has taught all of the greatest wizards and witches.

The university is so old that it's origins have been lost to time. There are fragments of the story but no one know the full story of why it is there or who built it. The city as a whole seems very connected to the university in many different ways.

The University has a lot of influence in the cities politics with all of the members being directly linked to the university and having almost all of the cities funding coming from the university as well.
